# Supply Chain Risk Platform

Supply Chain Risk is a `GTR` (`Group Technology Risk`) vendor risk management PoC that starts with `vendor security / cyber / technology risk` and is intended to evolve into a broader `supply chain risk` platform over time.

Current repository state:

- this codebase was inherited from the earlier `risk-calculator` shell
- the product is now being refactored around `vendor cases`, `assessment cycles`, `questionnaires`, `evidence`, `findings`, `approvals`, and `reassessments`
- some legacy risk-calculator infrastructure still exists while the vendor-risk workflows become the primary product surface

Important pilot boundary:

- this environment is still a PoC sandbox
- do not use real company names, customer data, live contract data, or live incident details
- use dummy vendors, dummy evidence, and masked contract language only

This repository contains:

- the frontend SPA used for the PoC portals
- the Vercel-hosted serverless API routes used by the shared pilot environment

## Product Direction

Phase 1 focus:

- vendor onboarding and assessment
- vendor security / cyber / technology risk
- AI-assisted internal review
- evidence collection and clause recommendation
- approval, conditional approval, and clarification loops

Later direction:

- broader supply chain risk coverage
- deeper vendor profiling and continuous monitoring
- Jira-linked open risk tracking
- Entra, email, SharePoint, and procurement-tool integration

## What The PoC Does Now

Current first-class platform capabilities:

- internal intake and case creation
- a vendor-facing portal for questionnaire completion, file upload, clarifications, and follow-up
- an internal portal for GTR review, findings, clause checks, and approval decisions
- AI-assisted intake classification, service-type inference, evidence review, and risk-summary drafting
- business-unit-scoped administration with both `global admin` and `BU admin`
- a foundation for periodic reassessment and open-risk lifecycle tracking

## Portals

The PoC has three separate interfaces:

- `Admin portal`
  - global administration and BU-scoped administration
- `Internal portal`
  - GTR and internal-team workflow for intake, review, findings, and approval
- `Vendor portal`
  - external-party experience for questionnaire responses, evidence uploads, and clarification handling

Typical local routes:

- `#/admin/home`
- `#/internal/home`
- `#/vendor/home`

## Primary Roles

Current working roles:

- `admin`
  - global admin with full backend and platform access
- `bu_admin`
  - BU-scoped admin with access limited to their business unit, including BU-scoped user management and BU-scoped audit visibility
- `gtr_analyst`
- `reviewer`
- `approver`
- `vendor_contact`

PoC-ready but not necessarily required in every workflow path yet:

- `privacy`
- `legal`
- `procurement`

## Current Workflow

1. Internal team creates a vendor case and captures intake details.
2. AI builds an initial assessment frame, including likely service type, data profile, regulatory impact, and criticality context.
3. The vendor receives case-linked access and completes the right questionnaire path.
4. The vendor uploads supporting evidence and answers clarification requests.
5. Internal reviewers assess responses, evidence, required clauses, and likely findings.
6. AI drafts recommendations, clause coverage gaps, and vendor risk summary content for the internal team.
7. The case moves to approval, conditional approval, or follow-up remediation.
8. The platform retains the case for reassessment and future open-risk tracking.

## AI And Grounding Model

The platform is AI-infused, but AI is intended to run through backend workflows rather than as a browser-trusted orchestration layer.

Current AI responsibilities:

- intake interpretation and service-type classification
- dynamic questionnaire selection based on service scope
- vendor-response gap and inconsistency analysis
- uploaded-document and evidence review
- clause recommendation and required-clause coverage checks
- draft findings, risk statements, likelihood / impact / mitigation summaries

Current AI behavior:

- the browser is a thin client for the key AI workflows rather than the authoritative orchestration layer
- server routes own prompt construction, structured-output repair, quality gates, readiness evaluation, and fallback policy
- vendor-assessment analysis is designed to run server-side so clause checks, scenario interpretation, service-type reasoning, and recommendations are not trusted to browser-only prompts
- duplicate suppression now happens on both sides:
  - the browser suppresses same-input repeat clicks and very recent identical reruns
  - the server reuses identical in-flight work and short-lived recent results for the main AI routes
- server AI routes emit lightweight operational metrics for invocation volume, latency, timeout pressure, fallback/manual rate, and duplicate/cache reuse
- explicit fallback and unavailable states are surfaced instead of silently masquerading as live AI

Grounding direction for this product:

- uploaded evidence such as policies, ISO certificates, SOC 2 reports, and clause packs should be reviewable by backend AI workflows
- service-type-specific control expectations should be grounded by the questionnaire and clause-pack templates
- future integrations should allow supporting evidence and risk actions to connect to SharePoint and Jira without changing the core domain model

## Current Domain Model Direction

The repo is moving toward these first-class concepts:

- `vendor_case`
- `assessment_cycle`
- `questionnaire_response`
- `evidence_item`
- `risk_record`
- `review_task`
- `approval_decision`

This is a deliberate shift away from the older scenario-first risk-calculator framing.

## Near-Term Roadmap

High-value next steps after the current PoC foundations:

- vendor magic-link onboarding flow
- richer internal review workbench
- open-risk tracking screens with later Jira linkage
- periodic reassessment orchestration
- Privacy / Legal checklist integration in the main workflow
- Entra, email, and SharePoint integration once the PoC flow is stable

## Pilot AI Readiness Policy

Pilot and staging environments should be treated as live-AI-required when AI quality matters.

Current policy:
- live-vs-degraded status is determined server-side
- deterministic fallback is continuity support, not pilot-quality live AI
- the hosted proxy is the normal path for pilot and production
- browser-direct keys and runtime overrides are localhost-only debugging controls
- if pilot or staging users are relying on AI quality for sign-off, check the server-reported mode in `Admin > System Access`

Current product behavior:
- `Admin > System Access` now shows a `Pilot AI readiness` card
- that card distinguishes:
  - `Live`
  - `Degraded`
  - `Deterministic fallback`
  - `Manual only`
- `Refresh server status` triggers a new server-side health check
- localhost can still expose debugging overrides, but those do not replace the server-reported mode used for pilot/prod trust decisions
- migrated workflows now label deterministic fallback and manual states explicitly instead of presenting them as equivalent to live AI quality

Operational expectation:
- do not treat fallback-generated AI guidance as pilot-quality AI output
- verify the server-reported mode in `System Access` before AI-dependent review, demo, or sign-off activity
- if the platform is intentionally being exercised in deterministic fallback or manual mode, be explicit about that in the session context
- when AI drafting or refinement fails, use `Admin > System Access` for full Compass failure diagnostics and `Admin > Audit Log` for the short inline summary:
  - the audit row now exposes failure stage and whether the prompt was truncated before send
  - the diagnostics panel still carries the full prompt footprint, response preview, and attempt history

## Results And Exports

Results are intentionally split by audience:

- Executive Summary
  - management interpretation
  - tolerance posture
  - immediate action framing
  - benchmark/value context
- Technical Detail
  - FAIR inputs
  - histogram
  - loss exceedance curve
  - challenge and validation layer
- Appendix & Evidence
  - provenance
  - assumptions
  - citations
  - challenge review

Additional trust signals now shown in the workflow:
- citation age warnings in evidence views
- benchmark age labels and stale-benchmark warnings in estimation
- saved-assessment freshness advisories when older runs are reopened

Export options currently include:
- JSON export
- printable HTML/PDF-style report flow
- direct jsPDF download
- decision memo
- board note
- PPTX spec export stub

## Evaluation Harness

The repository now includes a benchmark fixture and two evaluation paths so quality is not judged only by static exact-match rules.

Benchmark fixture:
- [tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_master_repaired.jsonl](./tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_master_repaired.jsonl)
- [tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_growth_pack.jsonl](./tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_growth_pack.jsonl)
  - bounded supplemental pack for live PoC drift areas such as AI/model-risk abstention, privacy transfer/retention, supplier delay, vendor access, workforce fatigue, ESG substantiation, continuity fallback, and transformation-delivery drift
- fixture rows can also carry `expected_doc_ids` so the local eval can score retrieval quality, not only lens and risk-title quality

Commands:
- `npm run test:eval:fixture`
  - validates that the shipped benchmark fixture stays complete and balanced
- `npm run eval:local -- --mode stub`
  - runs the current Step 1 scenario-assist path against the fixture using the browser LLM service in fast local stub mode
- `npm run eval:local -- --mode live`
  - runs the same harness against live AI using `RC_COMPASS_API_KEY` / `RC_COMPASS_API_URL` / `RC_COMPASS_MODEL`
- `npm run eval:ai -- --report test-results/eval/local-eval-report.json`
  - uses a second AI pass as a semantic judge over the generated outputs, so the benchmark is not only a static deterministic score
- `npm run eval:harvest -- exported-user-state.json`
  - mines real user interaction exports for high-signal candidate scenarios that should feed the next benchmark revision

Outputs:
- local deterministic report: `test-results/eval/local-eval-report.json`
- AI judge report: `test-results/eval/ai-judge-report.json`
- harvested growth candidates: `test-results/eval/eval-growth-candidates.jsonl`

Current eval focus:
- targeted slices are now used to harden thin domains one by one instead of relying only on whole-fixture averages
- retrieval scoring now reports precision, recall, and F1 where `expected_doc_ids` are present
- recent targeted slices include geopolitical, legal / contract, investment / JV, AI / model risk, data governance / privacy, fraud / integrity, physical security, OT / industrial resilience, people / workforce, supply chain, and procurement

Additional regression coverage:
- targeted unit packs now lock:
  - projection parity against the canonical taxonomy snapshot
  - bounded novel-wording paraphrases for Step 1 browser hinting
  - retrieval relevance for the highest-drift grounding themes in `docs.json`
  - supplemental eval-growth rows that represent real PoC-style wording expansion rather than only the original gold set

The intended operating loop is:
1. run `eval:local`
2. run `eval:ai` on the failures or a targeted slice
3. review the overlap between deterministic failures and AI-judge failures
4. promote only the strongest real-world growth candidates into the fixture after human review

This keeps the benchmark grounded by a stable gold set while still using AI as a semantic checker and user behaviour as a source of new benchmark cases.

## AI Feedback Learning Loop

The product now includes a structured Step 1 AI feedback loop for:
- the generated scenario draft
- the generated risk shortlist
- individual generated risk cards when a user rates or removes them

Current behavior:
- users can rate each on a 1-5 scale
- users can attach concise reason tags such as:
  - wrong domain
  - too generic
  - missed key risk
  - unrelated risks
  - weak citations
  - useful with edits
- feedback is stored with the active runtime mode:
  - `live_ai`
  - `fallback`
  - `local`
- `Admin > AI Feedback & Tuning` now shows who submitted recent feedback events more clearly:
  - when the managed account directory has a matching person, the admin card shows display name plus `@username`
  - otherwise it falls back to the stored username
- when a user removes a generated risk, the product now asks why:
  - `Incorrect risk`
  - `Correct, but narrowing scope`
  - `Only partially relevant`

How that feedback improves the platform:
- feedback is still captured in the browser and shared to the server-backed org intelligence store
- authoritative learning-profile resolution now happens server-side
- repeated live-AI signals can then shape:
  - user-level server user-state priors
  - function-level priors
  - BU-level priors
  - global shared priors
- for the currently migrated Step 1 workflows, those priors are now applied server-side to prompt/context guidance and risk ordering
- only clearly incorrect generated risks are promoted into the AI tuning path when removed; scope-narrowing and partial-relevance removals stay analyst-only so the system does not learn to suppress valid adjacent risks

Important guardrails:
- fallback feedback is tracked separately from live-AI feedback
- deterministic fallback continuity does not automatically become shared pilot-quality learning
- repeated shared patterns are promoted upward only after enough corroborating live-AI signals
- this is not direct online model retraining
- raw production clicks are not direct model training; curated offline review is still the path for benchmark and model-training updates

Plain-language boundary:
- the base LLM is not being re-trained each time a user moves a slider or saves a rating
- instead, the platform can use reviewed live-AI feedback signals to improve server-side ranking and prompt/context guidance where that path has been migrated
- if the organisation later wants true model training, that should come from reviewed and curated feedback data, not raw production clicks

Practical implication:
- better-quality repeated feedback can improve similar scenarios first at the governed server user tier, then for the wider function, BU, and platform once the signal is strong enough

## Global Admin Guide

Global admins now have a dedicated operating guide:
- [docs/global-admin-guide.md](./docs/global-admin-guide.md)

Use it alongside the role-aware in-product help on `#/help`.

Current global-admin priorities:
- use `#/admin/home` as the front door for platform work
- verify pilot AI readiness in `Admin > System Access` before demos, reviews, or sign-off sessions where AI quality matters
- review `Admin > AI Feedback & Tuning` before changing shared AI alignment, draft style, shortlist discipline, or learning sensitivity
- use the AI Feedback & Tuning drill-down to inspect recent events and low-scoring live-AI cases before changing shared policy
- if signal quality is contaminated or you need a clean restart, use the guarded reset flow in `Admin > AI Feedback & Tuning` to clear shared feedback, wipe saved user-tier AI feedback signals, and restore default tuning without deleting assessments
- keep company context, document library coverage, defaults, and access current before assuming a weak output is only a model problem
- treat platform-wide tuning as a governed change, not as an ad hoc reaction to one noisy session

## Product Quality Highlights

Current productization work now includes:
- premium UI polish across dashboard, wizard, results, settings, admin, and document library
- committed Step 1 start modes for guided, draft, and import/example paths instead of a single long scroll
- Step 1 now avoids background AI preview/prompt-idea traffic and keeps the authoritative draft path on one explicit server call
- tighter Step 1 domain hardening for continuity, finance, ESG, and geopolitical scenarios so shortlist and narrative drift is reduced even in deterministic fallback mode
- scenario memory and overlap checks in Step 1 without letting browser-local precedent silently steer inference quality
- stronger AI quality and coherence signaling
- role-aware examples and focus areas
- broader enterprise taxonomy and standards coverage
- review queue and management decision workflow
- clickable audit-log summary cards that drill recent platform activity by sign-in event and actor role
- reviewer brief, challenge mediation, challenge synthesis, and consensus recommendation flows in results
- living risk register, AI flags, correlation spotting, and board brief generation on role-aware dashboards
- watchlist confidence trajectory signals so reassessment queues show whether confidence is improving, declining, or flat
- direct PDF download
- worker-based Monte Carlo execution so simulation no longer blocks the UI thread
- streaming AI narrative refinement in Step 2
- portfolio heat map on the dashboard
- persisted session preferences for results tabs and boardroom mode
- server-authoritative AI status, orchestration, fallback, and learning-profile application
- normalized AI request shaping, duplicate suppression, and lightweight route analytics for the hosted AI paths
- KV-backed API rate limiting and login throttling for the shared pilot environment

### Backend

Serverless API routes hosted on Vercel.

Primary routes:
- [api/compass.js](./api/compass.js)
- [api/ai/status.js](./api/ai/status.js)
- [api/ai/scenario-draft.js](./api/ai/scenario-draft.js)

Shared backend helper:
- [api/_kvStore.js](./api/_kvStore.js)

- [api/_rateLimit.js](./api/_rateLimit.js)
- [api/_passwordPolicy.js](./api/_passwordPolicy.js)
- [api/_workflowReuse.js](./api/_workflowReuse.js)

Current AI runtime efficiency measures:
- register-analysis inputs are trimmed server-side before live model use to remove empty rows, repeated headers, and noisy workbook-style columns while preserving meaningful row order
- the main AI routes keep explicit `live`, `deterministic_fallback`, and `manual` semantics even when reuse or early-return paths are taken
- route metrics are in-memory and aggregate-only; no prompt, payload, or user content is logged in the lightweight analytics summaries

### Persistence Model

Current persistence spans:
- saved assessments
- draft state and draft recovery
- shared/server draft workspace is preferred on refresh; local browser draft recovery is now a one-time safety net instead of the default restore source
- personal user state
- shared admin settings
- shared admin settings and shared user state both use revision-based conflict detection on the server-backed APIs rather than last-write-wins
- settings screens now cancel stale autosave timers on rerender or `Load Latest`, so reloading the latest shared settings snapshot does not immediately re-trigger an old save callback from the previous screen instance
- organisation structure and scoped defaults
- feedback capture, templates, and local history caches
- server-applied learning profiles and shared AI feedback state
- review queue items
- audit events
- local pilot notifications
- session-scoped results preferences such as active tab and boardroom mode

## Local Development

Preferred Node version:

```bash
nvm use
```

Pinned in:
- [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc)
- [.node-version](./.node-version)
- [package.json](./package.json)

Run a local static server from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open:
- `http://localhost:8080`

Do not use `file://`.

## Environment Configuration

Do not commit real secrets, credentials, or tokens.

Reference shape:
- [.env.example](./.env.example)

That file covers the expected configuration for:
- frontend origin
- frontend origin allowlists
- Compass API access
- eval-harness Compass overrides
- session signing
- audit retention
- shared KV/user store access
- KV compatibility aliases still supported by the current codebase
- bootstrap admin/account seeding

AI environment notes:
- server-side pilot environments should provide real `COMPASS_API_KEY`, `COMPASS_API_URL`, and `COMPASS_MODEL` values
- the frontend defaults to the hosted proxy path and should normally run keyless in the browser
- pilot and production should rely on the hosted proxy plus the server-reported mode in `Admin > System Access`
- localhost-only overrides exist for debugging, but they do not replace the server-reported mode used for operational trust

## Deployment

### Frontend
- GitHub Pages
- workflow: [.github/workflows/pages.yml](./.github/workflows/pages.yml)

### Backend
- deploy `api/` routes to Vercel
- configure KV and secrets there
- use [ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md](./ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md) for rollback steps

## PoC Architecture Limits And Azure Path

Current PoC architecture limits:
- the product is currently split across a static GitHub Pages frontend and Vercel-hosted serverless APIs, so hosting, routing, secrets, and rollback are not yet managed inside one enterprise platform boundary
- shared persistence is intentionally pilot-grade:
  - Vercel/serverless APIs plus shared KV are sufficient for the PoC review queue, shared settings, and shared user-state flows
  - they are not yet positioned as a full enterprise system of record with durable workflow orchestration, enterprise reporting pipelines, or broad downstream integrations
- some resilience and UX safeguards are still browser-scoped by design:
  - local draft recovery
  - session-scoped preferences
  - in-app pilot notifications
  - bounded shared-result snapshots so reviewers can open work across browser sessions
- notifications and review routing are currently in-app only; there is no separate email, Teams, workflow-engine, or ticketing integration path yet
- identity and account management are still pilot-oriented:
  - managed accounts and signed session tokens exist
  - enterprise SSO, Entra ID lifecycle management, conditional access, and group-driven provisioning are not yet the active runtime model in this repo
- observability is intentionally lightweight for the PoC:
  - AI route metrics are aggregate and in-memory
  - admin/runtime status views are product-facing rather than a full central operations stack

Expected Azure deployment improvements:
- a more unified hosting model instead of the current GitHub Pages plus Vercel split
- enterprise identity integration, expected to move toward Microsoft Entra ID rather than shared PoC-style account handling
- stronger centralised data, audit, and operational controls than the current pilot KV/browser safety-net mix
- better support for durable notifications, richer management workflow routing, and broader enterprise integration patterns
- fuller observability, access governance, and environment control than the current pilot-grade runtime surfaces

Important note:
- the Azure items above describe the intended improvement direction, not features already implemented in this repository today
- until that deployment path is complete, treat the current system as a pilot architecture with deliberate PoC constraints

## Pilot Seed Data

Sample pilot seed/reference data:
- [data/pilot-seed/bootstrap-accounts.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/bootstrap-accounts.sample.json)
- [data/pilot-seed/demo-assessments.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/demo-assessments.sample.json)
- [data/pilot-seed/demo-user-state.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/demo-user-state.sample.json)

Suggested usage:
- copy bootstrap accounts JSON into `BOOTSTRAP_ACCOUNTS_JSON` for pilot seeding
- import sample assessments through the dashboard when needed
- treat the sample user-state file as a reference shape, not a migration script

## Managed Pilot Accounts

Current managed-account behavior:
- global admins can create, reset, and delete shared pilot users from `Admin > User Account Control`
- usernames are still derived from the display name in a predictable dot-normalised format such as `andy.ben.dyke`
- passwords are now issued server-side on both account creation and password reset
- issued passwords are random, policy-compliant credentials rather than sequential `RiskPilot!/PilotRisk!` style strings
- new or reset passwords are shown only in the current admin session, so admins should copy or hand them over immediately

Operational note:
- the API still accepts an explicitly supplied password for controlled/manual administration paths, but the normal product flow now relies on server-issued random credentials so create and reset stay aligned

## QA

Core checks:

```bash
npm run check:syntax
npm run test:unit
npm run check:smoke
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:eval:fixture
npm run eval:local
node scripts/readme-scan.js
```

App-integrity gate:

```bash
npm run qa:app
```

AI-quality gate:

```bash
npm run qa:ai
```

Full release gate:

```bash
npm run qa:release
```

What the split gates mean for this application:
- `qa:app` is the blocking engineering gate: syntax, taxonomy sync, smoke guardrails, unit coverage, eval fixture contract, docs consistency, and full Playwright
- `qa:ai` is the model-quality gate: deterministic local eval plus explicit threshold enforcement
- `qa:release` is the strict local promotion gate and runs both

What `qa:app` covers for this application:
- static syntax and smoke guardrails
- taxonomy projection consistency
- full unit coverage
- deterministic eval-fixture coverage for AI/RAG contract stability
- full Playwright coverage, not just the smoke subset
- documentation and release-contract consistency
- a managed ephemeral static SPA origin for browser verification, so the gate does not inherit whatever already happens to be running on localhost

For this SPA plus hosted-API architecture, the browser release bar now also expects:
- cold-session `/#/login -> sign in -> first authenticated render` coverage
- role-capability checks that depend on hydrated shared org structure
- empty-state verification for review surfaces so failures do not masquerade as “empty”
- hosted API origin usage from browser modules instead of raw relative `/api/...` fetches

Browser test best practice for this repository:
- use `npm run test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e:smoke`, not raw `npx playwright test`
- the package scripts provision a clean localhost static server automatically unless `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` is already set
- that matters here because warm or reused localhost origins can hide the exact cold-session hydration and wrong-origin browser/API issues this application is most exposed to

Eval gate best practice for this repository:
- do not treat `eval:local` as an informational report only; `qa:ai` and `qa:release` fail when release thresholds are missed
- the release checker is mode-aware:
  - `stub` mode gates taxonomy, risk recall/leakage, anchor coverage, retrieval coverage, and retrieval F1
  - `live` mode gates those same metrics and also limits fallback dependence
- for this product, a green browser suite is not enough if the scenario eval still shows weak lane discipline, weak grounding, or excessive AI fallback

CI policy for this repository:
- `Pilot CI` now has a blocking app-integrity job and a separate AI-quality job
- the AI-quality job stays visible and uploads the eval report artifact, but it does not block `master` while the current stub-quality baseline is still below target
- actual release promotion should still use local `npm run qa:release`, not only the non-blocking CI AI job

Repository consistency scan:
- `node scripts/readme-scan.js`
- verifies expected file structure, config pins, package scripts, FAIR engine markers, role/review states, feedback-learning tags, evidence-contract fields, export seams, API security markers, eval harness presence, and pilot seed data
- use it when updating the README, release docs, repo layout, or other documented platform contracts

Targeted security coverage now also checks:
- signed session-token validation and tamper rejection
- blocked origins on protected API routes
- fail-closed throttling when the shared KV store is unavailable
- rejected unexpected fields on sensitive auth requests
- timing-safe admin-secret comparison paths

Full pilot release gate:

```bash
npm run qa:release
```

Release checklist:
- [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

Rollback playbook:
- [ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md](./ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md)

## Security Notes

This is still a pilot codebase, not a finished production security architecture, but the repo now includes stronger hardening than earlier iterations.

Current hardening includes:
- hashed password storage and legacy upgrade path
- server-issued random password generation for managed account create and reset flows
- session-token-based API authorization
- timing-safe session-signature and admin-secret validation
- role-based API protection
- strict request parsing with unexpected-field rejection on shared API routes
- fail-closed rate limiting and login throttling in the shared pilot environment
- validated origin allowlists before CORS echoing
- improved SSRF guardrails around company-context fetching
- degraded-safe audit persistence so audit-store failures do not silently corrupt core auth responses
- safer escaping on admin/settings surfaces that render stored names, context, and other retained content
- central route guards
- unit, syntax, smoke, and E2E release gating

Still treat the system as pilot-grade and continue hardening before any production use.

## Change Guidance

When modifying the product:
- preserve the executive vs technical results split
- preserve role-specific dashboard semantics
- preserve progressive disclosure rather than adding persistent clutter
- prefer existing seams over inventing new subsystems
- keep visible trust, evidence, and workflow state coherent
- keep premium polish calm, not flashy
- run syntax, unit, smoke, and relevant E2E checks before pushing
