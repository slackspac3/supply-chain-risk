# Risk Intelligence Platform

Risk Intelligence Platform is an internal enterprise risk decision-support product. It combines guided scenario building, AI-assisted structuring, FAIR-style quant logic, Monte Carlo simulation, evidence-grounded retrieval, and executive-grade reporting in one role-aware workflow.

Important pilot boundary:
- this environment is still a PoC sandbox
- do not use real company names, customer data, or live incident details
- create dummy scenarios only
- prefer generic labels such as `supplier`, `customer`, `service provider`, or `business unit`

This repository contains:
- the GitHub Pages frontend SPA
- the Vercel-hosted serverless API routes used by the shared pilot environment

## What The Product Does

The platform helps a user move from a vague issue to a structured, challengeable, quantified management view.

Core capabilities:
- role-based dashboards for standard users, function admins, BU admins, and global admins
- AI-assisted risk and context builder
- scenario refinement and structured scenario shaping
- plain-language estimation and advanced tuning
- FAIR-style Monte Carlo simulation
- executive, technical, and appendix result views
- treatment comparison and better-outcome analysis
- direct PDF export plus printable decision memo / board note outputs
- evidence, provenance, assumptions, confidence, and citation surfacing
- document-grounded retrieval across standards, frameworks, and regulations
- review submission and management sign-off workflow
- admin governance for organisation setup, defaults, users, audit, and document library

## Current Workflow

1. Dashboard
2. Start or resume an assessment
3. Step 1: AI-assisted risk and context builder
4. Step 2: scenario refinement and narrative shaping
5. Step 3: estimation and advanced tuning
6. Review & Run
7. Results
   - Executive Summary
   - Technical Detail
   - Appendix & Evidence
8. Compare a better outcome, export, submit for review, or revisit later

## Enterprise Risk Coverage

The product now supports a broader enterprise risk lens, not only cyber. Current first-class or actively modeled domains include:

- strategic
- operational
- cyber
- third-party
- regulatory
- financial
- ESG
- compliance
- supply chain
- procurement
- business continuity
- HSE
- AI / model risk
- data governance / privacy
- fraud / integrity
- legal / contract
- geopolitical / market access
- physical security
- OT / industrial resilience
- people / workforce / human rights
- investment / JV
- project / programme / transformation delivery

## Review And Approval Flow

Completed assessments that breach tolerance, approach tolerance, or trigger annual review can now move into a lightweight management-review workflow.

Current behavior:
- the results hero can prompt the user to submit the assessment for review
- submitted items are stored in the shared review queue API
- admins and BU admins can view the review queue from Platform Home
- reviewers can approve, request changes, or escalate
- results surfaces now reflect:
  - pending
  - approved
  - changes requested
  - escalated

Pilot note:
- the queue is backed by shared KV
- notifications are currently local/browser-scoped for the pilot

## AI And Grounding Model

The product is assistant-driven, not chat-first. AI is used to:
- improve and structure scenario drafts
- refine narratives
- generate challenge prompts
- suggest likely risk groupings
- build evidence-backed interpretation

Current AI behavior:
- the browser is now a thin client for the key AI workflows rather than the authoritative orchestration layer
- server routes own prompt construction, structured-output repair, quality gates, readiness evaluation, and fallback policy for the main guided, register, treatment, and reviewer/challenge flows
- `Build scenario draft` remains the single authoritative Step 1 intelligence call; guided prompt ideas and pre-build preview are now deterministic/local so they do not add extra hosted backend traffic
- Step 1 pre-draft hinting is now projection-first:
  - the browser ranks competing taxonomy families, lenses, confidence, and separation before showing prompt ideas or a preferred local lens
  - ambiguous close-call wording stays soft instead of forcing a hard lane from a single generic token such as `payment`, `breach`, `outage`, or `supplier`
  - bounded browser fallback heuristics only run when the taxonomy projection is absent or clearly too weak
  - the committed browser projection snapshot is now parity-checked against the canonical taxonomy, and can be regenerated with `npm run sync:taxonomy-projection`
  - bounded novel-wording evals now cover paraphrase and near-miss phrasing across ransomware/extortion, privacy/retention/transfer, supplier delay, workforce fatigue, ESG, availability attack, payment-control-vs-fraud, and third-party access wording
- browser API base-URL resolution is now config-driven: Vercel-hosted fronts stay same-origin, while static fronts use the configured hosted API origin without extra discovery requests
- client workflow requests are normalized before transport so semantically identical inputs produce a stable request shape
- duplicate suppression now happens on both sides:
  - the browser suppresses same-input repeat clicks and very recent identical reruns
  - the server reuses identical in-flight work and short-lived recent results for the main AI routes
- server AI routes now emit lightweight operational metrics for invocation volume, latency, timeout pressure, fallback/manual rate, and duplicate/cache reuse
- wizard steps can still carry short-term runtime context memory across the draft flow
- bounded AI rewriting is used where draft quality matters
- explicit fallback and unavailable states are surfaced instead of silently masquerading as live AI
- retrieval uses a stronger local hybrid scorer with lens-aware and concept-aware matching, but browser-local learning weights no longer authoritatively shape inference quality
- domain guardrails now explicitly keep common continuity, counterparty-credit, ESG/human-rights, and geopolitical scenarios from drifting into adjacent cyber, fraud, or procurement lanes unless the user input actually supports that crossover
- remaining browser-side helper AI stays assistive-only for bounded UX features such as company-context drafting and scenario memory; it is not part of the trusted assessment or review path
- supporting documents and standards are cited into the workflow and results

The product is grounded by a growing enterprise corpus that includes ISO, NIST, COSO, IFRS/ESRS, OECD, UNGP, sector guidance, and UAE/GCC-relevant references.

## Pilot AI Readiness Policy

Pilot and staging environments should be treated as live-AI-required when AI quality matters.

Current policy:
- live-vs-degraded status is determined server-side
- deterministic fallback is continuity support, not pilot-quality live AI
- the hosted proxy is the normal path for pilot and production
- browser-direct keys and runtime overrides are localhost-only debugging controls
- if pilot or staging users are relying on AI quality for sign-off, check the server-reported mode in `Admin > System Access`

Current product behavior:
- `Admin > System Access` now shows a `Pilot AI readiness` card
- that card distinguishes:
  - `Live`
  - `Degraded`
  - `Deterministic fallback`
  - `Manual only`
- `Refresh server status` triggers a new server-side health check
- localhost can still expose debugging overrides, but those do not replace the server-reported mode used for pilot/prod trust decisions
- migrated workflows now label deterministic fallback and manual states explicitly instead of presenting them as equivalent to live AI quality

Operational expectation:
- do not treat fallback-generated AI guidance as pilot-quality AI output
- verify the server-reported mode in `System Access` before AI-dependent review, demo, or sign-off activity
- if the platform is intentionally being exercised in deterministic fallback or manual mode, be explicit about that in the session context

## Results And Exports

Results are intentionally split by audience:

- Executive Summary
  - management interpretation
  - tolerance posture
  - immediate action framing
  - benchmark/value context
- Technical Detail
  - FAIR inputs
  - histogram
  - loss exceedance curve
  - challenge and validation layer
- Appendix & Evidence
  - provenance
  - assumptions
  - citations
  - challenge review

Export options currently include:
- JSON export
- printable HTML/PDF-style report flow
- direct jsPDF download
- decision memo
- board note
- PPTX spec export stub

## Evaluation Harness

The repository now includes a benchmark fixture and two evaluation paths so quality is not judged only by static exact-match rules.

Benchmark fixture:
- [tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_master_repaired.jsonl](./tests/fixtures/eval/g42_eval_master_repaired.jsonl)

Commands:
- `npm run test:eval:fixture`
  - validates that the shipped benchmark fixture stays complete and balanced
- `npm run eval:local -- --mode stub`
  - runs the current Step 1 scenario-assist path against the fixture using the browser LLM service in fast local stub mode
- `npm run eval:local -- --mode live`
  - runs the same harness against live AI using `RC_COMPASS_API_KEY` / `RC_COMPASS_API_URL` / `RC_COMPASS_MODEL`
- `npm run eval:ai -- --report test-results/eval/local-eval-report.json`
  - uses a second AI pass as a semantic judge over the generated outputs, so the benchmark is not only a static deterministic score
- `npm run eval:harvest -- exported-user-state.json`
  - mines real user interaction exports for high-signal candidate scenarios that should feed the next benchmark revision

Outputs:
- local deterministic report: `test-results/eval/local-eval-report.json`
- AI judge report: `test-results/eval/ai-judge-report.json`
- harvested growth candidates: `test-results/eval/eval-growth-candidates.jsonl`

The intended operating loop is:
1. run `eval:local`
2. run `eval:ai` on the failures or a targeted slice
3. review the overlap between deterministic failures and AI-judge failures
4. promote only the strongest real-world growth candidates into the fixture after human review

This keeps the benchmark grounded by a stable gold set while still using AI as a semantic checker and user behaviour as a source of new benchmark cases.

## AI Feedback Learning Loop

The product now includes a structured Step 1 AI feedback loop for:
- the generated scenario draft
- the generated risk shortlist
- individual generated risk cards when a user rates or removes them

Current behavior:
- users can rate each on a 1-5 scale
- users can attach concise reason tags such as:
  - wrong domain
  - too generic
  - missed key risk
  - unrelated risks
  - weak citations
  - useful with edits
- feedback is stored with the active runtime mode:
  - `live_ai`
  - `fallback`
  - `local`
- when a user removes a generated risk, the product now asks why:
  - `Incorrect risk`
  - `Correct, but narrowing scope`
  - `Only partially relevant`

How that feedback improves the platform:
- feedback is still captured in the browser and shared to the server-backed org intelligence store
- authoritative learning-profile resolution now happens server-side
- repeated live-AI signals can then shape:
  - user-level server user-state priors
  - function-level priors
  - BU-level priors
  - global shared priors
- for the currently migrated Step 1 workflows, those priors are now applied server-side to prompt/context guidance and risk ordering
- only clearly incorrect generated risks are promoted into the AI tuning path when removed; scope-narrowing and partial-relevance removals stay analyst-only so the system does not learn to suppress valid adjacent risks

Important guardrails:
- fallback feedback is tracked separately from live-AI feedback
- deterministic fallback continuity does not automatically become shared pilot-quality learning
- repeated shared patterns are promoted upward only after enough corroborating live-AI signals
- this is not direct online model retraining
- raw production clicks are not direct model training; curated offline review is still the path for benchmark and model-training updates

Plain-language boundary:
- the base LLM is not being re-trained each time a user moves a slider or saves a rating
- instead, the platform can use reviewed live-AI feedback signals to improve server-side ranking and prompt/context guidance where that path has been migrated
- if the organisation later wants true model training, that should come from reviewed and curated feedback data, not raw production clicks

Practical implication:
- better-quality repeated feedback can improve similar scenarios first at the governed server user tier, then for the wider function, BU, and platform once the signal is strong enough

## Global Admin Guide

Global admins now have a dedicated operating guide:
- [docs/global-admin-guide.md](./docs/global-admin-guide.md)

Use it alongside the role-aware in-product help on `#/help`.

Current global-admin priorities:
- use `#/admin/home` as the front door for platform work
- verify pilot AI readiness in `Admin > System Access` before demos, reviews, or sign-off sessions where AI quality matters
- review `Admin > AI Feedback & Tuning` before changing shared AI alignment, draft style, shortlist discipline, or learning sensitivity
- use the AI Feedback & Tuning drill-down to inspect recent events and low-scoring live-AI cases before changing shared policy
- if signal quality is contaminated or you need a clean restart, use the guarded reset flow in `Admin > AI Feedback & Tuning` to clear shared feedback, wipe saved user-tier AI feedback signals, and restore default tuning without deleting assessments
- keep company context, document library coverage, defaults, and access current before assuming a weak output is only a model problem
- treat platform-wide tuning as a governed change, not as an ad hoc reaction to one noisy session

## Product Quality Highlights

Current productization work now includes:
- premium UI polish across dashboard, wizard, results, settings, admin, and document library
- committed Step 1 start modes for guided, draft, and import/example paths instead of a single long scroll
- Step 1 now avoids background AI preview/prompt-idea traffic and keeps the authoritative draft path on one explicit server call
- tighter Step 1 domain hardening for continuity, finance, ESG, and geopolitical scenarios so shortlist and narrative drift is reduced even in deterministic fallback mode
- scenario memory and overlap checks in Step 1 without letting browser-local precedent silently steer inference quality
- stronger AI quality and coherence signaling
- role-aware examples and focus areas
- broader enterprise taxonomy and standards coverage
- review queue and management decision workflow
- reviewer brief, challenge mediation, challenge synthesis, and consensus recommendation flows in results
- living risk register, AI flags, correlation spotting, and board brief generation on role-aware dashboards
- watchlist confidence trajectory signals so reassessment queues show whether confidence is improving, declining, or flat
- direct PDF download
- worker-based Monte Carlo execution so simulation no longer blocks the UI thread
- streaming AI narrative refinement in Step 2
- portfolio heat map on the dashboard
- persisted session preferences for results tabs and boardroom mode
- server-authoritative AI status, orchestration, fallback, and learning-profile application
- normalized AI request shaping, duplicate suppression, and lightweight route analytics for the hosted AI paths
- KV-backed API rate limiting and login throttling for the shared pilot environment

### Backend

Serverless API routes hosted on Vercel.

Primary routes:
- [api/compass.js](./api/compass.js)
- [api/ai/status.js](./api/ai/status.js)
- [api/ai/scenario-draft.js](./api/ai/scenario-draft.js)

- [api/user-state.js](./api/user-state.js)
- [api/review-queue.js](./api/review-queue.js)
- [api/audit-log.js](./api/audit-log.js)

Shared backend helper:
- [api/_kvStore.js](./api/_kvStore.js)
- [api/_apiAuth.js](./api/_apiAuth.js)
- [api/_audit.js](./api/_audit.js)
- [api/_aiRuntime.js](./api/_aiRuntime.js)

- [api/_rateLimit.js](./api/_rateLimit.js)
- [api/_passwordPolicy.js](./api/_passwordPolicy.js)
- [api/_workflowReuse.js](./api/_workflowReuse.js)

Current AI runtime efficiency measures:
- register-analysis inputs are trimmed server-side before live model use to remove empty rows, repeated headers, and noisy workbook-style columns while preserving meaningful row order
- the main AI routes keep explicit `live`, `deterministic_fallback`, and `manual` semantics even when reuse or early-return paths are taken
- route metrics are in-memory and aggregate-only; no prompt, payload, or user content is logged in the lightweight analytics summaries

### Persistence Model

Current persistence spans:
- saved assessments
- draft state and draft recovery
- shared/server draft workspace is preferred on refresh; local browser draft recovery is now a one-time safety net instead of the default restore source
- personal user state
- shared admin settings
- organisation structure and scoped defaults
- feedback capture, templates, and local history caches
- server-applied learning profiles and shared AI feedback state
- review queue items
- audit events
- local pilot notifications
- session-scoped results preferences such as active tab and boardroom mode

## Local Development

Preferred Node version:

```bash
nvm use
```

Pinned in:
- [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc)
- [.node-version](./.node-version)
- [package.json](./package.json)

Run a local static server from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open:
- `http://localhost:8080`

Do not use `file://`.

## Environment Configuration

Do not commit real secrets, credentials, or tokens.

Reference shape:
- [.env.example](./.env.example)

That file covers the expected configuration for:
- frontend origin
- frontend origin allowlists
- Compass API access
- eval-harness Compass overrides
- session signing
- audit retention
- shared KV/user store access
- KV compatibility aliases still supported by the current codebase
- bootstrap admin/account seeding

AI environment notes:
- server-side pilot environments should provide real `COMPASS_API_KEY`, `COMPASS_API_URL`, and `COMPASS_MODEL` values
- the frontend defaults to the hosted proxy path and should normally run keyless in the browser
- pilot and production should rely on the hosted proxy plus the server-reported mode in `Admin > System Access`
- localhost-only overrides exist for debugging, but they do not replace the server-reported mode used for operational trust

## Deployment

### Frontend
- GitHub Pages
- workflow: [.github/workflows/pages.yml](./.github/workflows/pages.yml)

### Backend
- deploy `api/` routes to Vercel
- configure KV and secrets there
- use [ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md](./ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md) for rollback steps

## Pilot Seed Data

Sample pilot seed/reference data:
- [data/pilot-seed/bootstrap-accounts.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/bootstrap-accounts.sample.json)
- [data/pilot-seed/demo-assessments.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/demo-assessments.sample.json)
- [data/pilot-seed/demo-user-state.sample.json](./data/pilot-seed/demo-user-state.sample.json)

Suggested usage:
- copy bootstrap accounts JSON into `BOOTSTRAP_ACCOUNTS_JSON` for pilot seeding
- import sample assessments through the dashboard when needed
- treat the sample user-state file as a reference shape, not a migration script

## QA

Core checks:

```bash
npm run check:syntax
npm run test:unit
npm run check:smoke
npm run test:e2e:smoke
node scripts/readme-scan.js
```

Repository consistency scan:
- `node scripts/readme-scan.js`
- verifies expected file structure, config pins, package scripts, FAIR engine markers, role/review states, feedback-learning tags, evidence-contract fields, export seams, API security markers, eval harness presence, and pilot seed data
- use it when updating the README, release docs, repo layout, or other documented platform contracts

Targeted security coverage now also checks:
- signed session-token validation and tamper rejection
- blocked origins on protected API routes
- fail-closed throttling when the shared KV store is unavailable
- rejected unexpected fields on sensitive auth requests
- timing-safe admin-secret comparison paths

Full pilot release gate:

```bash
npm run release:pilot
```

Release checklist:
- [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

Rollback playbook:
- [ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md](./ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md)

## Security Notes

This is still a pilot codebase, not a finished production security architecture, but the repo now includes stronger hardening than earlier iterations.

Current hardening includes:
- hashed password storage and legacy upgrade path
- session-token-based API authorization
- timing-safe session-signature and admin-secret validation
- role-based API protection
- strict request parsing with unexpected-field rejection on shared API routes
- fail-closed rate limiting and login throttling in the shared pilot environment
- validated origin allowlists before CORS echoing
- improved SSRF guardrails around company-context fetching
- degraded-safe audit persistence so audit-store failures do not silently corrupt core auth responses
- safer escaping on admin/settings surfaces that render stored names, context, and other retained content
- central route guards
- unit, syntax, smoke, and E2E release gating

Still treat the system as pilot-grade and continue hardening before any production use.

## Change Guidance

When modifying the product:
- preserve the executive vs technical results split
- preserve role-specific dashboard semantics
- preserve progressive disclosure rather than adding persistent clutter
- prefer existing seams over inventing new subsystems
- keep visible trust, evidence, and workflow state coherent
- keep premium polish calm, not flashy
- run syntax, unit, smoke, and relevant E2E checks before pushing
